# MNIST-Classification
Machine Learning techniques on MNIST dataset

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). In Georgia Tech class ISYE 6740, Computational Data Analysis, we used this dataset for the following methods:

[1. Classification](https://github.com/hannahpav/MNIST-Classification/blob/main/code/MNIST-clustering-algorithm.ipynb), with python code written without skitlearn or other packages.
[2. Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm and Guassian Mixture Model (GMM)](https://github.com/hannahpav/MNIST-Classification/blob/main/code/Implementing-EM-GMM-MNIST.ipynb)
[3. Comparison of KNN, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM, and Neural Network Classifiers](https://github.com/hannahpav/MNIST-Classification/blob/main/code/MNIST-Classifier-Comparisons.ipynb)
